# Real Estate Price Prediction Website

This data science project series walks through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. We will start by building a machine learning model using scikit-learn and linear regression, utilizing the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com. The project will then progress through three main components:

1. **Model Building with Scikit-Learn:**
   - We will leverage scikit-learn to build a predictive model for estimating home prices in Bangalore.
   - Key concepts covered include data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and K-fold cross-validation.
   - Technologies and tools used: Python, NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for data visualization, scikit-learn for model building, and Jupyter Notebook for experimentation.

2. **Django Server Implementation:**
   - Instead of Flask, we will use Django to develop the HTTP server that serves the machine learning model.
   - Django provides a robust framework for building web applications with features such as URL routing, template rendering, and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interaction.
   - We will implement views to handle incoming requests for predicting home prices based on user input.
   - Technologies used: Python Django for HTTP server implementation.

3. **Website Development:**
   - The third component involves building a user interface (UI) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Users will be able to input details such as home square footage and number of bedrooms into the website.
   - The website will then interact with the Django server to retrieve predicted home prices based on the provided inputs.

## Technology and Tools Used:
- Python: Programming language used for data manipulation, model building, and server development.
- NumPy and Pandas: Python libraries used for data cleaning and manipulation.
- Matplotlib: Python library used for data visualization.
- scikit-learn: Python library used for machine learning model building.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development environment used for experimentation and documentation.
- Visual Studio Code and PyCharm: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) used for code development.
- Django: High-level Python web framework used for implementing the HTTP server.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Web development technologies used for building the user interface.

## Directory Structure:
- **data:** Contains the dataset files.
- **notebooks:** Contains Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, model building, and experimentation.
- **django_server:** Contains the Django server implementation.
- **website:** Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Follow the instructions in each component's directory (`notebooks`, `django_server`, `website`) to set up and run the respective parts of the project.
